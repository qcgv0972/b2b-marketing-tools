## FAQ

**What's the difference between basic email marketing and marketing automation platforms?**

Basic email marketing sends messages to lists on schedules you define manually. Marketing automation platforms trigger personalized sequences based on prospect behavior, score leads automatically, route hot prospects to sales teams, and adjust campaigns dynamically as engagement patterns change. For B2B companies, automation becomes essential once you're managing more than a few dozen active leads simultaneously, as manual tracking becomes impossible and opportunities slip through gaps. The right platform pays for itself by converting prospects who would otherwise be lost to insufficient follow-up.

**How do I choose between enterprise platforms like Marketo and SME-focused tools like Plezi?**

Enterprise platforms suit organizations with dedicated marketing operations teams, complex multi-touch campaigns across global markets, and budgets exceeding several thousand dollars monthly. They provide extensive customization but require significant training investments. SME-focused platforms like Plezi, Brevo, and ActiveCampaign offer powerful automation with faster setup, gentler learning curves, and pricing starting under $200 monthly. Choose based on team size, campaign complexity, and whether you have marketing ops specialists or need tools that generalist marketers can master quickly.

**Can marketing automation platforms integrate with our existing CRM?**

Most modern platforms integrate with major CRMs including Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, Zoho, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 through native connectors or Zapier. Pardot integrates natively with Salesforce, HubSpot unifies its own CRM with marketing tools, and platforms like Plezi and ActiveCampaign connect to multiple CRMs. Verify your specific CRM appears in the integration list before committing, and test the bidirectional data sync during trial periods to ensure contact records, activities, and lead scores transfer correctly between systems without manual intervention.
